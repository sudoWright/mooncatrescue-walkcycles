// Generate the Sprite Sheet for the specific MoonCat
let spriteSheet = MoonCatWalk.generateMoonCatSpriteSheet(tokenId, size);

// TODO updte these as the cat moves 
let frame = 0;
let direction = 0;

let x = frame * 32;
/* columns - left to right in the sprite sheet
  0 = frame 1
  ...
  7 = frame 8
*/
let y = direction * 32;
/* rows - top to bottom in the sprite sheet
  0 = right
  1 = up
  2 = down

// Get the dom element that will show the MoonCat walking (CSS for div https://github.com/sudoWright/mooncatrescue-walkcycles/blob/main/css/walk.css#L12-L20)
let animation = document.getElementById('animation');

// Set the Sprite Sheet offset for each of the walk cycles
animation.style.backgroundPosition = `-${x}px -${y}px`;
